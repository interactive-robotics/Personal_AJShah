# Personal_AJShah

This is the personal repository for my code from the Interactive Robotics group. Currently it contains the planning code for the work on deformable object manipulation and some of the initial code on changepoint detection for unstructured demonstrations.
I have recently added the trajectory labeling code for the LM-MIT project to this repo. This is under the directory LMProject
